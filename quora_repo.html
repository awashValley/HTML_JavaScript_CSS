<!-- What is the difference between "id" and "class" attributes in HTML?
   - [Zeeshan Siddiqui: December 6, 2015] 
     -> ID is for Identification. Class is for Classification.
     -> A human being is identified uniquely by a name. He is classified as an animal too.
     -> There are several breeds/classifications of dogs. And each dog can be uniquely identified by its name or characteristics.
     -> Similarly, an HTML element which is uniquely identifiable via its function/purpose on a webpage or in an application is 
        given the attribute ID. It can also be given a Class to enable grouping of similar characteristics elements.
     -> Eg. There can be many blue buttons. Hence ".blue" becomes a class. But on Login page there can be only one "Login" button,
            hence the ID: btnLogin. This button can be blue as well. Therefore; -->
            <button id="btnLogin" class="blue btn">Login</button>
